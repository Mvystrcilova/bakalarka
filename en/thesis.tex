%%% Attachments to the bachelor thesis, if any. Each attachment must be

%%% are numbered.
%%%
%%% The printed version should preferably contain attachments, which can be
%%% read (additional tables and charts, supplementary text, examples of
%%% program output, etc.). The electronic version is more suited for attachments
%%% which will likely be used in an electronic form rather than read (program
%%% source code, data files, interactive charts, etc.). Electronic attachments
%%% should be uploaded to SIS and optionally also included in the thesis on a~CD/DVD.
%%% Allowed file formats are specified in provision of the rector no. 72/2017.
